            <h2>Slide 1</h2>
            <p>Why don't you hit the
                <kbd>S</kbd>
                key on your keyboard?</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Awesome, you made it to our secret party!</p>

            <h2>Slide 2</h2>
            <p>Do you see a new tab/window, by any chance? That's where the magic happens.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>You can put anything you like in these notes - the HTML is copied per slide to the secondary screen.</p>
                <oL>
                    <li>Why not put an ordered list here?</li>
                    <li>I'm sure I can make some kind of point with it.</li>
                    <li>You know. Whatever.</li>

            <h2>Slide 3</h2>
            <p>This presesentation window is made for projectors, so people can see and read this text.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>If you put this tab on your secondary screen, probably a laptop, you can use it for both notes and prepared snippets.</p>
                <oL>
                    <li>First talk about the code, then copy-paste it into the box on the other screen.</li>
                    <li>
                        <code>this.is("My Code").sampleToCopyPaste();</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>First go to the webpage, then copy-paste this demo-text from <a href="http://hipsteripsum.me/">Hipster Ipsum</a>.</li>
                    <li>
                        High Life PBR&amp;B vinyl, Schlitz lo-fi occupy you probably haven't heard of them meh commodo officia. Veniam direct trade banh mi yr wayfarers, reprehenderit magna Intelligentsia selfies ullamco. Tofu pour-over tattooed, placeat labore organic sriracha.
                    </li>
                    <li>It would be nice to control the primary screen from here too.</li>

            <h2>Slide 4</h2>
            <p>These slides are soooo pretty!</p>
            <aside>
                <p>The secondary screen isn't as pretty - yet! Please help me patch bespoke-secondary, perhaps by pulling in a super simple template of some sort.</p>

            <h2>Slide 5</h2>
            <p>That's it, really. I was bored, and wanted to create a bespoke.js plugin. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>And by bored, I mean procrastinating.</p>
                <p>You should check out <a href="https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-remote-prototype">bespoke-remote prototype</a>, by <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/">Mark Dalgleish</a>, who created <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/">Bespoke.js</a>. It also has support for notes, and an unlimited number of screens - but it requires server side software for synchronization.</p>
                <p>The notes from bespoke-secondary should be compatible with bespoke-remote prototype, so go ahead!</p>
